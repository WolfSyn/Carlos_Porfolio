# [Project 1: Global Logistics Association - Data for Concatenate](https://github.com/WolfSyn/Carlos_Porfolio)
  Created a spreadsheet that tracks how many people you have in your membership also what plans they have, and their dues. 
  I scrapped this from my old job but these are the old members that have canceled their membership. so there are no red flags here...
  ive used basic excel to add old data to new data to make it more official, and also ive made it more simple to read to see the titles and to see what you have 
  under them. 
  Also, I transfered this data to SQL to manage and add more data when i need to add more members into this chart

# [project 2: Cosmetics inc - retail](https://github.com/WolfSyn/Carlos_Porfolio) 
I've created this spreadsheet that tracks three stores that collects data on how much money they have made in the past month...
This spreadsheet i made myself and had references from my old job that helped me make this. 
i've used SQL Funtions to add more data into this excel file, and also added a vizual so you can see it more clearly on how much they've made...
